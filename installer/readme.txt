How to use Clipman:
Clipman permits you to "bank" different things in your "Copy/paste" slot (a.k.a clipboard)
by making your 0 - 9 number keys on your keyboard as to miniature clipboard slots.

Please note for the following commands, the CTRL, SHIFT, and ALT keys on the LEFT are listened to only.

To store an item to a key, use the shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+<number>.
Whatever is currently stored in your clipboard will be stored to this slot.

To retreive an item from a key, use the shortcut CTRL+ALT+<number>.
The next time you paste text, the banked item will be pasted, provided you don't overwrite it with something else.

Happy Clipping!
